Please parse each sentence into a fact. If the sentence is describing clock-wise information, then 12 denotes top, 1 and 2 denote top_right, 3 denotes right, 4 and 5 denote down_right, 6 denotes down, 7 and 8 denote down_left, 9 denote left, 10 and 11 denote top_left. If the sentence is describing cardinal directions, then north denotes top, east denotes right, south denotes down, and west denotes left. If the sentence is a question, the fact starts with query. Otherwise, the fact starts with one of top, down, left, right, top_left, top_right, down_left, and down_right.

Semantic Parse: top_left("V", "G").

Sentence: The objects S and A are over there. The object S is lower and slightly to the left of the object A.
Semantic Parse: down_left("S", "A").

Sentence: D is diagonally below Z to the right at a 45 degree angle.
Semantic Parse: down_right("D", "Z").

Sentence: V is at Aâ€™s 9 o'clock.
Semantic Parse: left("V", "A").

Sentence: J is at O's 6 o'clock.
Semantic Parse: down("J", "O").

Sentence: H is below J at 4 o'clock.
Semantic Parse: down_right("H", "J").

Sentence: O is there and C is at the 5 position of a clock face.
Semantic Parse: down_right("C", "O").

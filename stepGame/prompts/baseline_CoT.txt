Given a story about spatial relations among objects, answer the relation between two queried objects. Possible relations are: overlap, above, below, left, right, upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, and lower-right. If a sentence in the story is describing clock-wise information, then 12 denotes above, 1 and 2 denote upper-right, 3 denotes right, 4 and 5 denote lower-right, 6 denotes below, 7 and 8 denote lower-left, 9 denote left, 10 and 11 denote upper-left. If the sentence is describing cardinal directions, then north denotes above, east denotes right, south denotes below, and west denotes left.

Story:
If H is the center of a clock face, X is located between 4 and 5.
V is directly north east of D.
H and E are next to each other with H on the left and E on the right.
What is the relation of the agent H to the agent E?
Answer: We first link H and E using the relations in the story. H is to the left of E. So the answer is left.

Story:
I and P are parallel, and I on the right of P.
K is above I and to the right of I.
B and P are parallel, and B is to the right of P.
P is below J with a small gap between them.
T is below A at 7 o'clock.
What is the relation of the agent I to the agent B?
Answer: We first link I and B using the relations in the story. I is to the right of P. P is to the left of B. So the answer is overlap.

Story:
Z is below S with a small gap between them.
The object M is positioned directly below the object J.
A is on the left side of and below M.
Y presents upper right to N.
B is positioned down and to the left of M.
N is over there and C is on the right.
W and A are parallel, and W on the left of A.
S and D are both there with the object S is to the right of object D.
W is at the bottom of D.
Z is at Wâ€™s 9 o'clock.
What is the relation of the agent A to the agent M?
Answer: We first link A and M using the relations in the story. A is to the lower-left of M. So the answer is lower-left.

Story:
H and Y are in a horizontal line with H on the left.
V is at the 6 o'clock position relative to X.
The object U is positioned below and to the right of the object W.
R is diagonally left and below D.
Z presents below I.
Z is diagonally above P to the right at a 45 degree.
Object P is above object R and to the left of it, too.
I is placed on the top of V.
N is positioned up and to the right of D.
X is at Z's 6 o'clock.
Y is over there and V is at the bottom of it.
What is the relation of the agent N to the agent X?
Answer: We first link N and X using the relations in the story. N is to the upper-right of D. D is to the upper-right of R. R is to the lower-right of P. P is to the lower-left of Z. Z is above X. So the answer is upper-right.

Story:
H and K are side by side with K at the bottom and H on the top.
P is below K with a small gap between them.
U is there and Z is at the 10 position of a clock face.
Object A is above object M and to the right of it, too.
D is to the right of H horizontally.
P and C are parallel, and P is to the right of C.
G and C are vertical and G is above C.
Q and E are next to each other with Q on the left and E on the right.
The object O is positioned below and to the right of the object J.
E is above S at 2 o'clock.
F and J are both there with the object F is to the right of object J.
Z is over there and N is on the left.
Y is diagonally left and below L.
If U is the center of a clock face, G is located between 10 and 11.
F is directly above W.
P is directly north west of V.
S is there and L is at the 10 position of a clock face.
Q is positioned below D.
N is to the bottom left of D.
If A is the center of a clock face, Q is located between 4 and 5.
What is the relation of the agent E to the agent Z?
Answer: We first link E and Z using the relations in the story. E is to the right of Q. Q is below D. D is to the upper-right of N. N is to the left of Z. So the answer is right.
